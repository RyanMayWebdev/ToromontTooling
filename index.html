            <h5>Before Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Equip proper PPE</li>
                <li>Inspect jacks and pump cart for loose or missing parts, damage and leaks</li>
                <li>Make sure articulation points of machine are locked</li>
                <li>Have appropriate weight rated stands ready to place under machine</li>
                <li>Refer to <a href="#cribbing">Blocking and Cribbing</a> for information on stands and supporting
                    machines</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Required PPE:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety glasses</li>
                <li>Cut resist gloves</li>
                <li>Hearing protection</li>
                <li>Work boots</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>How To Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Position Jack under machine and ensure it is on a flat, even surface and that the jacking point is
                    also flat and even. A piece of rubber or hardwood can be used to help with slightly uneven surfaces
                    and to reduce risk of slipping</li>
                <li>Connect hoses from pump cart to jack. These should be hand tight, tools should not be needed to
                    tighten</li>
                <li>Make sure wires and hoses do not create a trip hazard</li>
                <li>The pump cart has a lever with 3 positions. The center position is neutral, while the left and right
                    positions send flow to the respective port</li>
                <li>Position the lever so that flow is sent to the jacks resulting in them extending, when you wish to
                    lower them, position the lever in the opposite direction</li>
                <li>Use the remote in order to power on the pump cart and slowly extend the jacks, verifying that the
                    machine is being lifted evenly and that the jacks are staying centered and not shifting</li>
                <li>If the jacks must be elevated to gain more height, support the machine and reposition the jacks. To
                    support the machine and raise the jacks properly, please refer to proper <a
                        href="#cribbing">Blocking and Cribbing</a> techniques </li>
                <li>Once you have obtained the desired height, support the machine properly, test that it is stable and
                    then lower the jacks</li>
                <li>Clean up the work area, inspect tooling after use and return to the tool crib</li>
                <h5>*NOTE* if you are using the hydraulic jacks with a built in pump please see the information below
                </h5>
                <li>These jacks operate similar to the ones above however they have a built in pump and don't require
                    you to connect hoses</li>
                <li>You can adjust the base height of these jacks by added spacers that are stored in the tool crib</li>
                <li>Use the lever to change the direction of flow to raise or lower. Use the button on the wired
                    controller to activate the pump</li>

            <h5>Before Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Equip PPE</li>
                <li>Inspect wood blocks for splitting, crush damage, grease or nails/screws</li>
                <li>Stands should be free of damage, not greasy or oily and should be rated for the supported load</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Required PPE:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety glasses</li>
                <li>Cut resist gloves</li>
                <li>Hearing protection</li>

                <li>Kneeling pad recommended</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>How To Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Place wood blocks under the machine or stand/jack you wish to support</li>
                <li>Blocks should be placed perpendicular to the layer below them, meaning alternate the direction of
                    the blocks</li>
                <li>The height of the cribbing should be no higher than the width of the blocks</li>
                <li>Blocks should be placed towards the ends of the blocks below them, leaving a small amount of space
                    protruding from the end.</li>
                <li>Jack stands should be placed so that they evenly distribute the load, and also be on a flat, even
                    surface</li>
                <li>Wood placed on the stands will reduce the risk of slipping and provide a more level surface as they
                    compress</li>
                <li>It is a good practice that each set of stands, front or back, be able to support the entire weight
                    of the machine</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Before Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Read through the <a href="hytorque.pdf" target="_blank">manual</a> before use.</li>
                <li>Make sure required PPE is worn</li>
                <li>Inspect the tooling for any damages, leaks or missing parts</li>
                <li>Connect the hy-torque s3000X to the enerpac hydraulic pump unit using the supplied hoses, hoses
                    should be hand tight</li>
                <li>Make sure the pump gauge overlay is for the s3000x, this should be marked on the overlay</li>
                <li><strong>NEVER hold the hoses or the tool itself while in use, the hoses contain 10000 psi of pressure and
                    could severely injure you upon leaking or exploding. <br>
                    Additionally the tooling itself can jump off or pinch your hand, always keep distance between the
                    tooling and yourself when in use.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Required PPE:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety glasses</li>
                <li>Oil and cut resist gloves</li>
                <li>Hearing protection</li>
                <li>Work boots</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>How To Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the hoses are connected, plug in the pump</li>
                <li>The drive lug can be re-oriented depending on the direction you wish to turn the attached socket.
                    This can be done by pushing in the center of the opposite side of the drive lug itself</li>
                <li>Remove the drive lug and slide it in the opposite way it was removed in order to change direction,
                    making sure the splines align</li>
                <li>Ensure that the drive lug is locked in place before using the tool</li>
                <li>Place your socket onto the tool and then onto the bolt to be torqued</li>
                <li>Align the reaction arm against a solid surface, the arm can be realigned by pressing the latch on
                    the side of the arm, sliding it off and then realigning. Make sure the latch is locked afterwards
                </li>
                <li>When positioning the tool, be aware of pinch points, and also verify that the hoses will not come
                    into contact with anything that will result in damage</li>
                <li>Once the tool is positioned, position yourself in view of the pump gauge but away from the hy-torque
                    tool itself</li>
                <li>Using the remote press the on/adv button once to turn on the pump.</li>
                <li>Holding the on/adv button will cause the pump to operate and allow the tool to begin rotating</li>
                <li>Adjust the relief valve, by pulling up the black handle and then rotating. Before starting to
                    torque, always back the relief valve out so the gauge reads close to 0 psi/ft lbs</li>
                <li>In order to see the pressure/ ft lbs being applied, you will need to be holding the adv button.
                    While doing this set the desired ft lbs using the relief valve handle</li>
                <li>Once the desired torque has been set, hold the adv button until you see the socket rotate, let go of
                    the button once it stops rotating. You should then here a click as the tool resets itself</li>
                <li>Continue this process until the socket can no longer rotate while the gauge is reaching the set
                    ft/lbs. The bolt should now be torqued</li>
                <li>Once you are done with the tool, be sure to check for any leaks, clean up the area and put away the
                    tooling</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Before connecting hoses, relieve system pressure in the machine by keying on, enabling hydraulics
                    and operating joysticks.
                    Also relieve tank pressure by slowly opening the cap on the tank, SIS provides further detail on the
                    different cap styles</li>
                <li>Connect hoses to the flowmeter, the meter should be marked in and out. From the cab of the machine,
                    the left side will be you input and the right will be the return</li>
                <li>Connect the hose from the left side of the machine to the in side of the meter, and the right hose
                    to the out side of the meter.</li>

                    machine exhaust is being ventilated</li>
                <li>Slowly adjust the pressure adjustment knob until the required pressure setting is displayed on the
                    gauge</li>
                <li>On the left you should see a flow rate, adjust the machine as needed until you obtain the required
                    flow at the set psi rating.</li>
                <li>Once done, be sure to relieve pressure in the machine hydraulic system before disconnecting any
                    hoses</li>
                <li>The hoses may be hot at this time, so be careful when disconnecting. Some residual oil will be in

        <div class="toolinfocontainer">
            <h5>Before Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Equip PPE:</li>
                <li>Do not inflate a tire if you are aware that it has been operated below 80% of its
                    recommended inflation pressure.<br> In this situation the wheel assembly must be
                    disassembled, inspected, reassembled and inflated by a qualified tire contractor.</li>
                <li>Do not apply heat to wheel studs, nuts or rims. The heat can cause explosion or a fire within the tire. See your lead hand if the lug nuts/bolts are seized</li>
                <li>Support tire before removal, tires can be a crush hazard</li>
                <li>Inspect tire to be deflated/inflated for damage to tire or rim</li>
                <li>If there is any damage, contact a certified tire contractor</li>
                <li>Support the machine</li>
                <li>Position the valve stem at the top of the wheel in case it is liquid/calcium filled</li>
                <li>Mark the orientation and initial pressure of the tire</li>
                <li>Inspect tooling for damage, missing parts or leaks</li>
                <li>Block off area in front of tire in case of explosion, there are concrete blocks for the purpose, ask your lead hand or supervisor about them</li>
                <li>Refer to the manual attached to the tire inflation cart</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Required PPE:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Safety glasses</li>
                <li>Hearing protection</li>
                <li>Appropriate gloves</li>
                <li>Work boots</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>How To Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tires contain a lot of potential energy and can explode. Be sure area in front of tire is blocked off and never stand in front of the tire when inflating or deflating</strong></li>
                <li>Connect shop air to the tire inflation cart</li>
                <li>Connect the tire inflation cart hoses to the tire you wish to inflate or deflate. Two tires can be connected at a time</li>
                <li>Power on the unit and et the desired pressure using the + and - buttons. When deflating a tire, all tires should be deflated to between 5-10 psi to lower potential energy</li>
                <li>The cart should be positioned out of the way of the tire's potential trajectory</li>
                <li>Slide the blue collar into position so that air can flow to the hoses from the control unit</li>
                <li>The tire will now start to inflate/deflate, when this process is complete the control unit will emit a beep to indicate it has achieved the desired psi.</li>
                <li>Always verify the pressure with a manual gauge to be safe</li>
                <li>If removing the tire, once the pressure is between 5-10 psi you can safely remove the lug nuts/bolts. Support the tire before removing nuts/bolts</li>
            </ul>

        <h4><u>Propane Torches</u></h4>
        <div class="toolinfocontainer">
            <h5>Before Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Equip PPE</li>
                <li>Locate fire extinguishers in the area</li>
                <li>Remove flammable materials from work space</li>
                <li>Block off work area, use welding screens</li>
                <li>Make sure area is well ventilated, use smoke extractor</li>
                <li>Place steel plate under cutting area to prevent concrete floor from exploding due to heat</li>
                <li>Inspect torches, tips for debris or damage, regulators and cylinders. Ensure that torch hoses have flash arrestors installed, see your lead hand if they do not</li>
                <li>Check hoses/torch for leaks, this can be done by spraying soapy water on connections while there is pressure in the lines</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Required PPE:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Welding glasses/mask minimum shade #3</li>
                <li>Welding gloves and apron/jacket</li>
                <li>Smoke extractor/respirator</li>
                <li>Work boots</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>How To Use:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Open regulators on gas cylinders, propane first and then oxygen</li>
                <li>Torch pressure should be set to 7-15 psi for propane and 30 to 40 psi for oxygen</li>
                <li>Open the propane side of the torch slightly using the knob at the bottom of the handle</li>
                <li>Use a striker to light the torch, holding the torch tip near a metal surface can help with ignition</li>
                <li>Turn the propane knob until you have a flame around 6-8" in length</li>
                <li>Slowly open the oxygen knob until you see the flame begin changing to blue and getting shorter</li>
                <li>Adjust the knobs until the flames appear as a pointy blue triangle, you should be able to see a darker and lighter blue triangle that meet eachother</li>
                <li>There are a variety of ways and applications to use a torch, see your lead hand for instruction on the correct procedure for the application</li>
                <li>Be sure to never point the flame towards anyways, and to point the molten metal away from yourself and others.</li>
                <li>When you have finished using the torches, be sure to shutoff the gas supply at the tanks first in order to purge the lines. <strong>Shut off in this order: Propane first then Oxygen</strong></li>
                <li>Inspect the torches and hoses for damage before putting them away, beware the tip will be hot. Check that there is still gas remaining in the cylinders, if not replace them.</li>
            </ul>
